This is a simple HTML Contact Form styled using SASS. It's a bigginer project that helps you understand how SASS works.

**How I set it up**
I downloaded node.js from nodejs.org, then I installed node.js.
I created a folder, then I opened the folder using VSCode. I created an index.html file, a folder named sass, inside the sass folder, i created a style.sass file. I opened up my terminal in the VSCode, then I installed SASS globally by running: npm install -g sass.
Then I installed a sass extension called 'Live Sass Compiler' by Glenn Marks, then I activated it
That is all for the setup. Now I went to my style.sass file, then I started with my styling. The styling made in the sass was compiled into a style.css file. This style.css file is what was used to style the HTML form (the style.css file created automatically will be the one to be linked to the HTML file not the stlye.sass file)
